## Why ?

In PrestaShop, you can override default template for category, product or cms page but not for category CMS pages.

## How to use

Install the module (no override);

With the CMS category page, the module will check the following locations (in order) and return the first template found :

- ``themes/*/templates/en-US/cms/category-3.tpl``
- ``themes/*/templates/cms/category-3.tpl``
- ``themes/*/templates/en-US/cms/category.tpl``
- ``themes/*/templates/cms/category.tpl``
